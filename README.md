WINDOWS

For the Minecraft Launcher : C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming.minecraft\logs

macOS

Open 'Finder' on your taskbar. On the top bar, click on the 'Go' dropdown menu. Then click 'Go to Folder'. Type ~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft/bin. Then open your logs folder.

NOTES

If you don't have a debug.log, it might be named just debug. Check again.
If you don't have any "debug" file, update your modpack or install Forge 2705, if you are using the Minecraft Launcher.
Minecraft ALWAYS has these files. If you really can't find them under that folder, make sure you have Forge or any modpack installed! If you need any more support, ask in our Discord #support channel!
